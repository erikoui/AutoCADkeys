### Fixed
- Fixed issue #39
Almost complete rewrite of mouse polling code  
Multiple event types (Movement, mouse button events) supported per update ("stroke") of the mouse  
It is now possible to block a button or movement, but leave unblocked events unblocked  
Previously, a stroke was either blocked or not - if any one part of the stroke was blocked, it was all blocked  
### Changed
- [Monitor script] GUI layout made more robust
- [Monitor script] Add option to filter key presses and only show key releases

## [0.4.2] - 2019-06-08

When multiple mouse buttons changed state in one update of the mouse, only one event would be fired for one of the buttons

- Button state is no longer inverted as it was in 0.4.0

## [0.4.0] - 2019-05-14
### Added
- Concurrency switch for executing subscription callback functions. Was implicitly executing on a new thread from the pool, now there is an option to execute each callback on a single thread (one worker per subscription).
- UnsubscribeKey, UnsubscribeMouseButton, UnsubscribeMouseMove, UnsubscribeMouseMoveRelative, UnsubscribeMouseMoveAbsolute methods added to Subscription Mode
- "Unsubscription Example.ahk" to demo Subscribe / Unsubscribe
### Changed
- By default the new concurrency switch will be set to false meaning that for every subscription there will be only a single worker thread and callbacks will be run sequentially.
- Monitor now outputs data as would be seen in Subscription mode, rather than as it comes raw from Interception
- Monitor now shows key names
### Deprecated
